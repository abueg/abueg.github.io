Hello! I am a bioinformatician who enjoys using genomic resources and tools to answer evolutionary questions.

I have had experience conducting analyses for population genomic questions related to neutral population structure as well as potential signatures of adaptive evolution. I have extensive experience with next-generation and third-generation sequencing, particularly targeted exome sequencing and ddRAD approaches for the former, and PacBio and Oxford NanoPore long reads for the latter. I've worked exclusively in non-model organisms, so I am passionate about making resources available for researchers studying non-model systems, a goal I contributed to in my previous work at the [Vertebrate Genome Lab](https://www.vertebrategenomelab.org/). In my current position at The Rockefeller University's [HPC Resource Center](https://www.rockefeller.edu/hpc/), I continue to help researchers get their work done by educating them on how to best use HPC resources.
